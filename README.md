Zomato Data Analysis Using Python:

The aim of this project is to analyze customer ordering behaviors from Zomato data, specifically focusing on the differences between dining restaurants and cafes. The hypothesis is that dining restaurants primarily accept offline orders, while cafes primarily receive online orders. The goal is to verify this hypothesis through data analysis and visualization.
Steps Involved

1.	Data Collection:
o	Obtain the Zomato dataset. This dataset typically includes information about various restaurants, their types (e.g., cafes, dining restaurants), order types (online, offline), customer reviews, ratings, etc.

2.	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
o	Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
o	Inspect the dataset for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
o	Clean the data by handling missing values (e.g., filling them with appropriate values or dropping them) and removing duplicates.
o	Convert categorical variables (e.g., restaurant type) into numerical formats if needed for analysis.

3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o	Understand the basic statistics of the data such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
o	Use data visualization techniques to explore the distribution of order types (offline vs. online) across different types of establishments (dining restaurants vs. cafes).

4.	Analysis:
o	Distribution Analysis: Analyze the distribution of online and offline orders for both dining restaurants and cafes.
o	Comparison Analysis: Compare the frequency of online orders vs. offline orders between dining restaurants and cafes using visualizations such as bar charts and pie charts.
o	Statistical Analysis: Conduct statistical tests (e.g., chi-square test) to determine if the differences in ordering preferences are statistically significant.

5.	Visualization:
o	Create visual representations of the data to support the findings. This could include:
	Bar charts showing the count of offline and online orders for dining restaurants and cafes.
	Pie charts illustrating the proportion of offline vs. online orders for each type of establishment.
	Box plots to visualize the distribution and variability of order types across different restaurant categories.

CONCLUSION: Dining restaurants primarily accept offline orders, whereas cafes primarily receive online orders. This suggests that clients prefer to place orders in person at restaurants, but prefer online ordering at cafes.
